# HMAC

### Description
HMAC is an algorithm that helps verify the integrity and origin of data. The purpose of the topic is to learn the HMAC algorithm as well as the
selection of suitable hash functions such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-3. In
addition, the topic also analyzes how it works, the advantages and disadvantages, how
to choose the above hash functions as well as the impact of choosing an unsafe hash
function.
The report studied the necessary requirements for the HMAC algorithm and
commonly used hash functions. The demo programs at the end of the report will
illustrate this algorithm.
